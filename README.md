# Artificial Intelligence for Modern Board Games - "7 Wonders"
This repository contains the companion application discussed in the paper [Artificial Intelligence for Modern Boardgames](https://github.com/fmadrid/7Wonders/blob/master/Paper.pdf), the **7 Wonders** application facilitates the playing of the modern abstract board game *7 Wonders*.

This projects features two main components, a Java SE 7 based implementation of the *7 Wonders* ruleset and a series of intelligent agents incorporating different artificial intelligent paradigms such as Rules-Based systems.

All human input is performed using the numpad. No plans for a GUI exist at this time.

## Built With
* [JAVA SE 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
Project documentation in the **docs** folder was automatically generated by [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

## Usage
The file *Configuration.properties* can be used to change experiment parameters including the number of players and the artificial intelligence dictating the agent's actions while *Game.java* serves as the application's entry point.

I am not accepting external commits at this time.
